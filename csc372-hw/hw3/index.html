                                Don Japanese Restaurant is a great choice for lunch or dinner as 
                                they offer a variety of authentic dishes. Not only is the food 
                                superb, but the staff are very friendly and have done a good job 
                                making a cozy and Japanese inspired setting within the restaurant. 
                                With good food as well as a friendly and cozy atmosphere, Don is 
                                sure to be your go-to Japanese restaurant when you're craving some 
                                warm ramen.                            
                            </div>
                            <div id="gyoza-desc" style="display: none;">
                                Don offers a delicious 6-piece serving of gyozas that can come 
                                either fried or steamed. The dish comes with a ginger sauce(which 
                                pairs very well with the fried option), though white sauce tends to 
                                be the sauce of choice when considering these dumplings. These are 
                                by far the best gyozas obtainable
                                around campus!

                                There is quite the variety at Don when it comes to options of 
                                traditional Japanese soup. Whether your a fan of spicy ramen or beef
                                 udon, you're sure to find a bowl that will satisfy your cravings. 
                                 Featured this week is a personal favorite- a bowl of shoyu ramen 
                                 with chicken as it's protein.

                                Fajitas aren't the only meal that's served sizzling! Don has a 
                                selection of rice bowls to choose from. Bowls are served quite 
                                literally out of the pot, so you're guaranteed a hot, tasty meal!

                                Old Town Draught House holds a special place in the hearts of many. 
                                With daily drink specials, a friendly staff, and amazing pub food, 
                                it's no wonder why this is a staple for many students and locals 
                                alike! It's also worth notin that Old Town is practically a part of 
                                campus, what with it's semi-centralized location on campus right 
                                beside of Yum-Yum's and the Oakland parking deck.

                                Old Town's signature Smokehouse Burger isn't for the feint of heart.
                                This large sandwich is packed with beef, bacon, and(you guessed it) 
                                barbecue sauce. As wrapped up as you'll be enjoying this burger, 
                                remember to try and not make a mess of your shirt!

                                Refreshing and light, Old Town's Caesar Salad is a great choice if 
                                you're looking for a lighter meal. If you aren't, Old Town offers a 
                                meal size option along with various protein to add(though chicken 
                                and caesar salad is a to-die-for combo).

                                A classic! Old Town provides a great take on the philly cheesesteak.
